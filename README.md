# LAN Design 

> **Semester 4 Project** for the Communication Network Engineering module.

## 📚 **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on designing the **backbone network** for the **University of Moratuwa** and the **network distribution** for the ENTC building.  

### **Key Objectives**:
1. Design a long-term backbone network (20–25 years) for UOM.
2. Ensure connectivity for:
   - Academic faculties/departments
   - Administrative offices
   - Library and Data Center 
3. Optimize the **total cost of cabling** while considering both **active** and **passive** systems.
4. Configure routing for the backbone network using **OSPF**.

## 🛠️ **Design Highlights**
- **Backbone Network**: Connects multiple buildings on the UOM campus.  
- **ENTC Building Network**: Connects multiple floors and labs on the ENTC premises.
- Simulated using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

### **Components Considered**:
1. **Passive Systems**:
   - Copper and fiber cabling
   - Patch panels (copper & fiber)  
2. **Active Systems**:
   - Network switches
   - Routers

## 🔧 **Simulation Tools**
We used **Cisco Packet Tracer** to simulate:
1. **ENTC Network**
2. **Backbone Network**

## 🚀 **How to Run the Simulation**
1. Install Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Open Backbone_ENTC.pkt for the simulation.
3. Open OSPF.pkt for the routing configuration.
